SOAP:

- SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.
- SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol.
- SOAP uses services interfaces to expose the business logic.
- JAX-WS is the Java API for SOAP web services.
- SOAP defines standards to be strictly followed.
- SOAP requires more bandwidth and resource than REST.
- SOAP defines its own security.
- SOAP permits XML data format only.

Advantages of Soap Web Services:
WS Security: SOAP defines its own security known as WS Security.
Language and Platform independent: SOAP web services can be written in any programming language and executed in any platform.

Disadvantages of Soap Web Services:
Slow: SOAP uses XML format that must be parsed to be read. It defines many standards that must be followed while developing the SOAP applications.
So it is slow and consumes more bandwidth and resource.
WSDL dependent: SOAP uses WSDL and doesn't have any other mechanism to discover the service.

REST:

- REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
- REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP.
- REST uses URI to expose business logic.
- JAX-RS is the Java API for RESTful web services.
- REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.
- REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP.
- RESTful web services inherits security measures from the underlying transport.
- REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.

Advantages of RESTful Web Services:

Fast: RESTful Web Services are fast because there is no strict specification like SOAP. It consumes less bandwidth and resource.
Language and Platform independent: RESTful web services can be written in any programming language and executed in any platform.
Can use SOAP: RESTful web services can use SOAP web services as the implementation.
Permits different data format: RESTful web service permits different data format such as Plain Text, HTML, XML and JSON.
