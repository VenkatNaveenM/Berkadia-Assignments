Microservice:

A microservice is a single self-contained unit which, together with many others, makes up a large application.
By splitting your app into small units every part of it is independently deployable and scalable,
can be written by different teams and in different programming languages and can be tested individually.

micro is a tiny module that makes writing a microservice in Node.js a joy. Itâ€™s easy to use and super fast.

The Setup:

Install micro:  npm install -g micro

Starting our microservice:

$ micro index.js
