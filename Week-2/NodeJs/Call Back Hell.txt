CALL BACK HELL:

Multiple functions can be created independently and used as callback functions. These create multi-level functions. When this function tree created becomes too large, the code becomes incomprehensible sometimes and is not easily refactored. This is known as callback hell.

function setInfo(name) {
  address(myAddress) {
    officeAddress(myOfficeAddress) {
      telephoneNumber(myTelephoneNumber) {
        nextOfKin(myNextOfKin) {
          console.log('done'); 
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
