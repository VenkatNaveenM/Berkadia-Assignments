COMPONENT:

-In Angular when new component is created with help of CLI it is automatically added to root.module.ts
-Each component can have its own folder
-Component is a typescript class

export class ServerComponent{   }

DECORATORS:

-Decorators in typescript files are used to enhance the elements (Classes)
-These are used to tell angular that this is not a normal type script class. This is something special(A Component)

@Component()  <-- Decorator

We have to import it

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

To configure the decorator we have to pass the java script object

@Component({
     Selector: 'app-server'   <--- Metadata for class
	 TemplateUrl: './Server'
	 StyleUrl: './Styles.css'
})

@NgModule{
     declarations
	 imports
	 providers
	 bootstrap
	 }
	 
For manual adding component to the angular project creating component is not only enough we have to add it to the NgModule

import { ServerComponent } from '.server/ServerComponent';

declarations[
    ServerComponent
	]
	
Creating a new component by CLI:

ng generate component component_name
          or
    ng g c component_name
