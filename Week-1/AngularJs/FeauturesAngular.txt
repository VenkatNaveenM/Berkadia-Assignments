ANGULARJS FEATURES:

Angular has the following key features which makes it one of the powerful frameworks in the market.

MVC – The framework is built on the famous concept of MVC (Model-View-Controller).
      This is a design pattern used in all modern day web applications. 
	  This pattern is based on splitting the business logic layer, the data layer, and presentation layer into separate sections. 
	  The division into different sections is done so that each one could be managed more easily.

Data Model Binding – You don't need to write special code to bind data to the HTML controls. 
                     This can be done by Angular by just adding a few snippets of code.

Writing less code – When carrying out DOM manipulation a lot of JavaScript was required to be written to design any application. 
                    But with Angular, you will be amazed with the lesser amount of code you need to write for DOM manipulation.

Unit Testing ready – The designers at Google not only developed Angular but also developed a testing framework called "Karma" 
                     which helps in designing unit tests for AngularJS applications.
