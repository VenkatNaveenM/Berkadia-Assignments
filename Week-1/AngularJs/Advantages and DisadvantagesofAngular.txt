ADVANTAGES OF ANGULARJS:

Easy Language – Learning and working on AngularJS is quite easy as few simple modifications can 
                let you achieve the benefits of AngularJS in minimum possible time.
Two-way binding of data – Angular JS allows you to do two-way data binding that enables view and model 
    to coordinate with the changes in one another.
No need of observable functions – With ANgular JS you would not have to use observable functions as it analyzes the DOM and creates the bindings
                                  on the basis of Angular-specific element attributes. This saves times in writing lengthy codes.
Automatically joins the components – Most of the framework require the developers to divide the application into multiple small MVC components and write codes
                                     to join them again. However AngularJS solves this issue as it combines the components automatically.
									 
DISADVANTAGES OF ANGULARJS:

Not Secure – Its applications are not safe. Server side authentication and authorization is necessary to keep an application secure.
Not Degradable – If user of your application disables the JavaScript then it displays nothing except basic page.
Complex at times – At times AngularJS becomes complex to handles as there are multiple ways to do the same thing. 
                   This creates confusion and requires considerable efforts.
