ANGULARJS ARCHITECTURE:

Angular.js follows the MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller)

The Controller represents the layer that has the business logic. 
User events trigger the functions which are stored inside your controller. 
The user events are part of the controller.

Views are used to represent the presentation layer which is provided to the end users

Models are used to represent your data. 
The data in your model can be as simple as just having primitive declarations. 
For example, if you are maintaining a student application, your data model could just have a student id and a name. 
Or it can also be complex by having a structured data model. If you are maintaining a car ownership application,
you can have structures to define the vehicle itself in terms of its engine capacity, seating capacity, etc.
