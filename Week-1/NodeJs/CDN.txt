Content Delivery Networks:

-Content delivery networks (CDN) are the transparent backbone of the Internet in charge of content delivery.
-Every one interacts with CDNs on a daily basis; when reading articles on news sites,
 shopping online, watching YouTube videos or perusing social media feeds.
-To minimize the distance between the visitors and website server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content
 in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). 
-Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.
-CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to users. 
 For example, when someone in London accesses US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK PoP.
 This is much quicker than having the visitorâ€™s requests, and your responses, travel the full width of the Atlantic and back.
-This is how a CDN works in a nutshell. 
 Of course, as we thought we needed an entire guide to explain the inner workings of content delivery networks,
 the rabbit hole goes deeper.
