Content Delivery Networks:

-Content delivery networks (CDN) are the transparent backbone of the Internet in charge of content delivery.
-Every one interacts with CDNs on a daily basis; when reading articles on news sites,
 shopping online, watching YouTube videos or perusing social media feeds.
-To minimize the distance between the visitors and website server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content
 in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). 
-Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.
-CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to users. 
 For example, when someone in London accesses US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK PoP.
 This is much quicker than having the visitorâ€™s requests, and your responses, travel the full width of the Atlantic and back.
-This is how a CDN works in a nutshell. 
 Of course, as we thought we needed an entire guide to explain the inner workings of content delivery networks,
 the rabbit hole goes deeper.
-Beyond placing caching servers at the network edge, CDN providers use load balancing and application performance techniques to help data   reach users faster. These techniques include reducing file sizes using compression and special algorithms.
