MEAN AND MERN:

MEAN:

MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications.
The MEAN stack is MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js.
Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.
A common theme in the MEAN stack is JavaScript – every line of code you write can be in the same language. You even access the database using MongoDB's native, Idiomatic JavaScript/Node.js driver. 

MERN:

MERN is a scaffolding tool which makes it easy to build universal apps using Mongo, Express, React and NodeJS.
It minimises the setup time and gets you up to speed using proven technologies.
