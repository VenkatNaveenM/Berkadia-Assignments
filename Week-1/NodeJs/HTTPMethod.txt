HTTP Methods:

-> GET:

Used to retreive data from a server at the specified resource.
Making a GET request(/Users) gives list of all available users.

-> POST:

Used to send data to the API server to create/update resource.
It is non idempotent.

-> PUT:

Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
It is idempotent.

-> HEAD:

This method is almost identical to GET, except without the response body.
In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users.

-> DELETE:

Used to delete the specified resource.

-> OPTIONS:
