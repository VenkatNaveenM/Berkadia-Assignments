REQUEST:

The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.
In this documentation and by convention, the object is always referred to as req (and the HTTP response is res) but its actual name 
is determined by the parameters to the callback function in which youâ€™re working.

For example:

app.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {
  res.send('user ' + req.params.id);
});
But you could just as well have:

app.get('/user/:id', function(request, response) {
  response.send('user ' + request.params.id);
});
